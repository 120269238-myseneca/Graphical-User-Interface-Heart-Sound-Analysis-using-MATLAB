# Graphical-User-Interface-Heart-Sound-Analysis-using-MATLAB

Introduction

The Heartbeat Sound Analysis App is a project born out of necessity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recognizing the heart's essential role in determining life, I developed an application that measures heartbeats via sound. This app is aimed at aiding the general public by offering a free tool to easily monitor one's heart rate using just the sound of the heartbeat.

Features

- Simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) for ease of use
- Ability to input the sound of a heartbeat
- Instant analysis and display of heart rate

 Installation and Usage

1. Installation: Clone the repository or download the app from the provided link. Follow the installation instructions specific to your device.

2. Usage:
    - Open the file using matlab
    - Record or upload the sound of a heartbeat.
    - Click on "Analyze" to get the heart rate result.
  
 Heartbeatapp.m is code that can be put into a Matlab file to run for easier use, but the design of app will required. 
  
 Motivation

During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals would connect patients to heartbeat monitoring machines as soon as they were admitted. This made me realize the significance of monitoring the heart, as it's the most critical organ, and its failure often signifies a life-threatening situation. This application aims to provide every individual with a tool to measure their heart rate without the need for specialized equipment. My vision is to make it easier and accessible for everyone to monitor their heart's health.
